# Project 1: Navigation

### Project Goal
The project goal is to train a deep reinforcement learning agent to navigate a virtual world and collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

### Environment details

This project environment is based on [The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

> The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents) is an open-source project that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API. 

Note: The project environment provided by Udacity is similar to, but not identical to the [Banana Collector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector) environment on the Unity ML-Agents GitHub page.
